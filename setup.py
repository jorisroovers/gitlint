description = "Git commit message linter written in python, checks your commit messages for style."
long_description = """
Great for use as a commit-msg git hook or as part of your gating script in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g. jenkins).
Many of the gitlint validations are based on `well-known`_ community_ `standards`_, others are based on checks that
we've found useful throughout the years. Gitlint has sane defaults, but you can also easily customize it to your
own liking.
