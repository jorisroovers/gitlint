Great for use as a commit-msg git hook or as part of your gating script in a CI pipeline (e.g. Jenkins) . Note Gitlint support for Windows is experimental , and there are some known issues . Also, gitlint is not the only git commit message linter out there, if you are looking for an alternative written in a different language, have a look at fit-commit (Ruby), node-commit-msg (Node.js) or commitlint (Node.js). Important Gitlint no longer supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 as they have reached End-Of-Life . The last gitlint version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 is 0.14.0 (released on October 24th, 2020). Features Commit message hook : Auto-trigger validations against new commit message right when you're committing . Also works with pre-commit . Easily integrated : Gitlint is designed to work with your own scripts or CI system . Sane defaults: Many of gitlint's validations are based on well-known , community , standards , others are based on checks that we've found useful throughout the years. Easily configurable: Gitlint has sane defaults, but you can also easily customize it to your own liking . Community contributed rules : Conventions that are common but not universal can be selectively enabled . User-defined rules: Want to do more then what gitlint offers out of the box? Write your own user defined rules . Full unicode support: Lint your Russian, Chinese or Emoji commit messages with ease! Production-ready: Gitlint checks a lot of the boxes you're looking for: actively maintained, high unit test coverage, integration tests, python code standards (pep8, pylint), good documentation, widely used, proven track record.

Some exit codes are special . Configuration For in-depth documentation of general and rule-specific configuration options, have a look at the Configuration and Rules pages. Short example .gitlint file ( full reference ): [general] # Ignore certain rules (comma-separated list), you can reference them by # their id or by their full name ignore=body-is-missing,T3 # Ignore any data send to gitlint via stdin ignore-stdin=true # Configure title-max-length rule, set title length to 80 (72 = default) [title-max-length] line-length=80 # You can also reference rules by their id (B1 = body-max-line-length) [B1] line-length=123 Example use of flags: # Change gitlint's verbosity. $ gitlint -v # Ignore certain rules $ gitlint --ignore body-is-missing,T3 # Enable debug mode $ gitlint --debug # Load user-defined rules (see http://jorisroovers.github.io/gitlint/user_defined_rules) $ gitlint --extra-path /home/joe/mygitlint_rules Other commands and variations: $ gitlint --help Usage: gitlint [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Commands: generate-config Generates a sample gitlint config file. install-hook Install gitlint as a git commit-msg hook. lint Lints a git repository [default command] uninstall-hook Uninstall gitlint commit-msg hook. When no COMMAND is specified, gitlint defaults to 'gitlint lint'. Using gitlint as a commit-msg hook Introduced in gitlint v0.4.0 You can also install gitlint as a git commit-msg hook so that gitlint checks your commit messages automatically after each commit. gitlint install-hook # To remove the hook gitlint uninstall-hook Important Gitlint cannot work together with an existing hook. If you already have a .git/hooks/commit-msg file in your local repository, gitlint will refuse to install the commit-msg hook. Gitlint will also only uninstall unmodified commit-msg hooks that were installed by gitlint. If you're looking to use gitlint in conjunction with other hooks, you should consider using gitlint with pre-commit . Using gitlint through pre-commit gitlint can be configured as a plugin for the pre-commit git hooks framework. Simply add the configuration to your .pre-commit-config.yaml : - repo: https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint rev: # Fill in a tag / sha here hooks: - id: gitlint You then need to install the pre-commit hook like so: pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg Important It's important that you run pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg , even if you've already used pre-commit install before. pre-commit install does not install commit-msg hooks by default! To manually trigger gitlint using pre-commit for your last commit message, use the following command: pre-commit run gitlint --hook-stage commit-msg --commit-msg-filename .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG In case you want to change gitlint's behavior, you should either use a .gitlint file (see Configuration ) or modify the gitlint invocation in your .pre-commit-config.yaml file like so: - repo: https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint rev: # Fill in a tag / sha here hooks: - id: gitlint args: [--contrib=CT1, --msg-filename] Important You need to add --msg-filename at the end of your custom args list as the gitlint-hook will fail otherwise. Using gitlint in a CI environment By default, when just running gitlint without additional parameters, gitlint lints the last commit in the current working directory. This makes it easy to use gitlint in a CI environment (Jenkins, TravisCI, Github Actions, pre-commit, CircleCI, Gitlab, etc). In fact, this is exactly what we do ourselves: on every commit, we run gitlint as part of our CI checks . This will cause the build to fail when we submit a bad commit message. Alternatively, gitlint will also lint any commit message that you feed it via stdin like so: # lint the last commit message git log -1 --pretty=%B | gitlint # lint a specific commit: 62c0519 git log -1 --pretty=%B 62c0519 | gitlint Note that gitlint requires that you specify --pretty=%B (=only print the log message, not the metadata), future versions of gitlint might fix this and not require the --pretty argument. Linting a range of commits Introduced in gitlint v0.9.0 (experimental in v0.8.0) Gitlint allows users to lint a number of commits at once like so: # Lint a specific commit range: gitlint --commits \"019cf40...d6bc75a\" # You can also use git's special references: gitlint --commits \"origin..HEAD\" # Or specify a single specific commit in refspec format, like so: gitlint --commits \"019cf40^...019cf40\" The --commits flag takes a single refspec argument or commit range. Basically, any range that is understood by git rev-list as a single argument will work. For cases where the --commits option doesn't provide the flexibility you need, you can always use a simple shell script to lint an arbitrary set of commits, like shown in the example below. #!/bin/sh for commit in $(git rev-list master); do commit_msg=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B $commit) echo \"$commit\" echo \"$commit_msg\" | gitlint echo \"--------\" done Note One downside to this approach is that you invoke gitlint once per commit vs. once per set of commits. This means you'll incur the gitlint startup time once per commit, making this approach rather slow if you want to lint a large set of commits. Always use --commits if you can to avoid this performance penalty. Merge, fixup, squash and revert commits Introduced in gitlint v0.7.0 (merge), v0.9.0 (fixup, squash) and v0.13.0 (revert) Gitlint ignores merge, revert, fixup and squash commits by default. For merge and revert commits, the rationale for ignoring them is that most users keep git's default messages for these commits (i.e Merge/Revert \"[original commit message]\" ). Often times these commit messages are also auto-generated through tools like github. These default/auto-generated commit messages tend to cause gitlint violations. For example, a common case is that \"Merge:\" being auto-prepended triggers a title-max-length violation. Most users don't want this, so we disable linting on Merge and Revert commits by default. For squash and fixup commits, the rationale is that these are temporary commits that will be squashed into a different commit, and hence the commit messages for these commits are very short-lived and not intended to make it into the final commit history. In addition, by prepending \"fixup!\" or \"squash!\" to your commit message, certain gitlint rules might be violated (e.g. title-max-length ) which is often undesirable. In case you do want to lint these commit messages, you can disable this behavior by setting the general ignore-merge-commits , ignore-revert-commits , ignore-fixup-commits or ignore-squash-commits option to false using one of the various ways to configure gitlint . Ignoring commits Introduced in gitlint v0.10.0 You can configure gitlint to ignore specific commits or parts of a commit. One way to do this, is to by adding a gitline-ignore line to your commit message . If you have a case where you want to ignore a certain type of commits all-together, you can use gitlint's ignore rules. Here's an example gitlint file that configures gitlint to ignore rules title-max-length and body-min-length for all commits with a title starting with \"Release\" . [ignore-by-title] # Match commit titles starting with Release regex=^Release(.*) ignore=title-max-length,body-min-length # ignore all rules by setting ignore to 'all' # ignore=all [ignore-by-body] # Match commits message bodies that have a line that contains 'release' regex=(.*)release(.*) ignore=all If you just want to ignore certain lines in a commit, you can do that using the ignore-body-lines rule. # Ignore all lines that start with 'Co-Authored-By' [ignore-body-lines] regex=^Co-Authored-By Warning When ignoring specific lines, gitlint will no longer be aware of them while applying other rules. This can sometimes be confusing for end-users, especially as line numbers of violations will typically no longer match line numbers in the original commit message. Make sure to educate your users accordingly. Note If you want to implement more complex ignore rules according to your own logic, you can do so using user-defined configuration rules . Named Rules Introduced in gitlint v0.14.0 Named rules allow you to have multiple of the same rules active at the same time, which allows you to enforce the same rule multiple times but with different options. Named rules are so-called because they require an additional unique identifier (i.e. the rule name ) during configuration. Warning Named rules is an advanced topic. It's easy to make mistakes by defining conflicting instances of the same rule. For example, by defining 2 body-max-line-length rules with different line-length options, you obviously create a conflicting situation. Gitlint does not do any resolution of such conflicts, it's up to you to make sure any configuration is non-conflicting. So caution advised! Defining a named rule is easy, for example using your .gitlint file: # By adding the following section, you will add a second instance of the # title-must-not-contain-word (T5) rule (in addition to the one that is enabled # by default) with the name 'extra-words'. [title-must-not-contain-word:extra-words] words=foo,bar # So the generic form is # [<rule-id-or-name>:<your-chosen-name>] # Another example, referencing the rule type by id [T5:more-words] words=hur,dur # You can add as many additional rules and you can name them whatever you want # The only requirement is that names cannot contain whitespace or colons (:) [title-must-not-contain-word:This-Can_Be*Whatever$YouWant] words=wonderwoman,batman,power ranger When executing gitlint, you will see the violations from the default title-must-not-contain-word (T5) rule, as well as the violations caused by the additional Named Rules. $ gitlint 1: T5 Title contains the word 'WIP' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" 1: T5:This-Can_Be*Whatever$YouWant Title contains the word 'wonderwoman' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" 1: T5:extra-words Title contains the word 'foo' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" 1: T5:extra-words Title contains the word 'bar' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" 1: T5:more-words Title contains the word 'hur' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" Named rules are further treated identical to all other rules in gitlint: You can reference them by their full name, when e.g. adding them to your ignore configuration # .gitlint file example [general] ignore=T5:more-words,title-must-not-contain-word:extra-words You can use them to instantiate multiple of the same user-defined rule You can configure them using any of the ways you can configure regular gitlint rules Exit codes Gitlint uses the exit code as a simple way to indicate the number of violations found. Some exit codes are used to indicate special errors as indicated in the table below. Because of these special error codes and the fact that bash only supports exit codes between 0 and 255 , the maximum number of violations counted by the exit code is 252. Note that gitlint does not have a limit on the number of violations it can detect, it will just always return with exit code 252 when the number of violations is greater than or equal to 252. Exit Code Description 253 Wrong invocation of the gitlint command. 254 Something went wrong when invoking git. 255 Invalid gitlint configuration","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Gitlint is a git commit message linter written in python: it checks your commit messages for style.

[title-must-not-contain-word:extra-words] words=foo,bar # So the generic form is # [<rule-id-or-name>:<your-chosen-name>] # Another example, referencing the rule type by id [T5:more-words] words=hur,dur # You can add as many additional rules and you can name them whatever you want # The only requirement is that names cannot contain whitespace or colons (:) [title-must-not-contain-word:This-Can_Be*Whatever$YouWant] words=wonderwoman,batman,power ranger When executing gitlint, you will see the violations from the default title-must-not-contain-word (T5) rule, as well as the violations caused by the additional Named Rules. $ gitlint 1: T5 Title contains the word 'WIP' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" 1: T5:This-Can_Be*Whatever$YouWant Title contains the word 'wonderwoman' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" 1: T5:extra-words Title contains the word 'foo' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" 1: T5:extra-words Title contains the word 'bar' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" 1: T5:more-words Title contains the word 'hur' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: foo wonderwoman hur bar\" Named rules are further treated identical to all other rules in gitlint: You can reference them by their full name, when e.g. adding them to your ignore configuration # .gitlint file example [general] ignore=T5:more-words,title-must-not-contain-word:extra-words You can use them to instantiate multiple of the same user-defined rule You can configure them using any of the ways you can configure regular gitlint rules","title":"Named Rules"},{"location":"#exit-codes","text":"Gitlint uses the exit code as a simple way to indicate the number of violations found.

To enable certain contrib rules, you can use the --contrib flag. $ cat examples/commit-message-1 | gitlint --contrib contrib-title-conventional-commits,CC1 1: CC1 Body does not contain a 'Signed-off-by' line 1: CL1 Title does not start with one of fix, feat, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test: \"WIP: This is the title of a commit message.\" # These are the default violations 1: T3 Title has trailing punctuation (.): \"WIP: This is the title of a commit message.\" 1: T5 Title contains the word 'WIP' (case-insensitive): \"WIP: This is the title of a commit message.\" 2: B4 Second line is not empty: \"The second line should typically be empty\" 3: B1 Line exceeds max length (123>80): \"Lines typically need to have a max length, meaning that they can't exceed a preset number of characters, usually 80 or 120.\" Same thing using a .gitlint file: [general] # You HAVE to add the rule here to enable it, only configuring (such as below) # does NOT enable it. contrib=contrib-title-conventional-commits,CC1 [contrib-title-conventional-commits] # Specify allowed commit types.

Thanks for considering to add a new one to gitlint! Before starting, please read all the other documentation on this page about contributing first. Then, we suggest taking the following approach to add a Contrib rule: Write your rule as a user-defined rule . In terms of code, Contrib rules are identical to user-defined rules, they just happen to have their code sit within the gitlint codebase itself. Add your user-defined rule to gitlint . You should put your file(s) in the gitlint/contrib/rules directory. Write unit tests . The gitlint codebase contains Contrib rule test files you can copy and modify . Write documentation . In particular, you should update the gitlint/docs/contrib_rules.md file with details on your Contrib rule. Create a Pull Request : code review typically requires a bit of back and forth. Thanks for your contribution! Contrib rule requirements If you follow the steps above and follow the existing gitlint conventions wrt naming things, you should already be fairly close to done. In case you're looking for a slightly more formal spec, here's what gitlint requires of Contrib rules. Since Contrib rules are really just user-defined rules that live within the gitlint code-base, all the user-rule requirements also apply to Contrib rules. All contrib rules must have associated unit tests. We sort of enforce this by a unit test that verifies that there's a test file for each contrib file. All contrib rules must have names that start with contrib- . This is to easily distinguish them from default gitlint rules. All contrib rule ids must start with CT (for LineRules targeting the title), CB (for LineRules targeting the body) or CC (for CommitRules). Again, this is to easily distinguish them from default gitlint rules. All contrib rules must have unique names and ids. You can add multiple rule classes to the same file, but classes should be logically grouped together in a single file that implements related rules. Contrib rules should be meaningfully different from one another. If a behavior change or tweak can be added to an existing rule by adding options, that should be considered first. However, large god classes that implement multiple rules in a single class should obviously also be avoided. Contrib rules should use options to make rules configurable.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"We'd love for you to contribute to gitlint.

If you want to check whether your rules are properly discovered by gitlint, you can use the --debug flag: $ gitlint --debug --extra-path examples/ # [output cut for brevity] UC1: body-max-line-count body-max-line-count=3 UC2: body-requires-signed-off-by UL1: title-no-special-chars special-chars=['$', '^', '%', '@', '!', '*', '(', ')'] Note In most cases it's really the easiest to just copy an example from the examples directory and modify it to your needs. The remainder of this page contains the technical details, mostly for reference. Line and Commit Rules The SignedOffBy class above was an example of a user-defined CommitRule . Commit rules are gitlint rules that act on the entire commit at once. Once the rules are discovered, gitlint will automatically take care of applying them to the entire commit. This happens exactly once per commit. A CommitRule contrasts with a LineRule (see e.g.: examples/my_line_rules.py ) in that a CommitRule is only applied once on an entire commit while a LineRule is applied for every line in the commit (you can also apply it once to the title using a target - see the examples section below). The benefit of a commit rule is that it allows commit rules to implement more complex checks that span multiple lines and/or checks that should only be done once per commit. While every LineRule can be implemented as a CommitRule , it's usually easier and more concise to go with a LineRule if that fits your needs. Examples In terms of code, writing your own CommitRule or LineRule is very similar. The only 2 differences between a CommitRule and a LineRule are the parameters of the validate(...) method and the extra target attribute that LineRule requires. Consider the following CommitRule that can be found in examples/my_commit_rules.py : # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from gitlint.rules import CommitRule, RuleViolation class SignedOffBy(CommitRule): \"\"\" This rule will enforce that each commit contains a \"Signed-off-by\" line. We keep things simple here and just check whether the commit body contains a line that starts with \"Signed-off-by\". \"\"\" # A rule MUST have a human friendly name name = \"body-requires-signed-off-by\" # A rule MUST have a *unique* id, we recommend starting with UC # (for User-defined Commit-rule). id = \"UC2\" def validate(self, commit): self.log.debug(\"SignedOffBy: This will be visible when running `gitlint --debug`\") for line in commit.message.body: if line.startswith(\"Signed-off-by\"): return msg = \"Body does not contain a 'Signed-off-by' line\" return [RuleViolation(self.id, msg, line_nr=1)] Note the use of the name and id class attributes and the validate(...) method taking a single commit parameter. Contrast this with the following LineRule that can be found in examples/my_line_rules.py : # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from gitlint.rules import LineRule, RuleViolation, CommitMessageTitle from gitlint.options import ListOption class SpecialChars(LineRule): \"\"\" This rule will enforce that the commit message title does not contai any of the following characters: $^%@!*() \"\"\" # A rule MUST have a human friendly name name = \"title-no-special-chars\" # A rule MUST have a *unique* id, we recommend starting with UL # for User-defined Line-rule), but this can really be anything. id = \"UL1\" # A line-rule MUST have a target (not required for CommitRules). target = CommitMessageTitle # A rule MAY have an option_spec if its behavior should be configurable. options_spec = [ListOption('special-chars', ['$', '^', '%', '@', '!', '*', '(', ')'], \"Comma separated list of characters that should not occur in the title\")] def validate(self, line, _commit): self.log.debug(\"SpecialChars: This will be visible when running `gitlint --debug`\") violations = [] # options can be accessed by looking them up by their name in self.options for char in self.options['special-chars'].value: if char in line: msg = f\"Title contains the special character '{char}'\" violation = RuleViolation(self.id, msg, line) violations.append(violation) return violations Note the following 2 differences: extra target class attribute : in this example set to CommitMessageTitle indicating that this LineRule should only be applied once to the commit message title. The alternative value for target is CommitMessageBody , in which case gitlint will apply your rule to every line in the commit message body. validate(...) takes 2 parameters : Line rules get the line against which they are applied as the first parameter and the commit object of which the line is part of as second. In addition, you probably also noticed the extra options_spec class attribute which allows you to make your rules configurable. Options are not unique to LineRule s, they can also be used by CommitRule s and are further explained in the Options section below. The commit object Both CommitRule s and LineRule s take a commit object in their validate(...) methods. The table below outlines the various attributes of that commit object that can be used during validation. Property Type Description commit.message object Python object representing the commit message commit.message.original string Original commit message as returned by git commit.message.full string Full commit message, with comments (lines starting with #) removed. commit.message.title string Title/subject of the commit message: the first line commit.message.body string[] List of lines in the body of the commit message (i.e. starting from the second line) commit.author_name string Name of the author, result of git log --pretty=%aN commit.author_email string Email of the author, result of git log --pretty=%aE commit.date datetime Python datetime object representing the time of commit commit.is_merge_commit boolean Boolean indicating whether the commit is a merge commit or not. commit.is_revert_commit boolean Boolean indicating whether the commit is a revert commit or not. commit.is_fixup_commit boolean Boolean indicating whether the commit is a fixup commit or not. commit.is_squash_commit boolean Boolean indicating whether the commit is a squash commit or not. commit.parents string[] List of parent commit sha s (only for merge commits). commit.changed_files string[] List of files changed in the commit (relative paths). commit.branches string[] List of branch names the commit is part of commit.context object Object pointing to the bigger git context that the commit is part of commit.context.current_branch string Name of the currently active branch (of local repo) commit.context.repository_path string Absolute path pointing to the git repository being linted commit.context.commits object[] List of commits gitlint is acting on, NOT all commits in the repo. Violations In order to let gitlint know that there is a violation in the commit being linted, users should have the validate(...) method in their rules return a list of RuleViolation s. Important The validate(...) method doesn't always need to return a list, you can just skip the return statement in case there are no violations. However, in case of a single violation, validate should return a list with a single item. The RuleViolation class has the following generic signature: RuleViolation(rule_id, message, content=None, line_nr=None): With the parameters meaning the following: Parameter Type Description rule_id string Rule's unique string id message string Short description of the violation content string (optional) the violating part of commit or line line_nr int (optional) line number in the commit message where the violation occurs. Automatically set to the correct line number for LineRule s if not set explicitly. A typical validate(...) implementation for a CommitRule would then be as follows: def validate(self, commit) for line_nr, line in commit.message.body: if \"Jon Snow\" in line: # we add 1 to the line_nr because we offset the title which is on the first line return [RuleViolation(self.id, \"Commit message has the words 'Jon Snow' in it\", line, line_nr + 1)] return [] The parameters of this RuleViolation can be directly mapped onto gitlint's output as follows: Options In order to make your own rules configurable, you can add an optional options_spec attribute to your rule class (supported for both LineRule and CommitRule ). # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from gitlint.rules import CommitRule, RuleViolation from gitlint.options import IntOption class BodyMaxLineCount(CommitRule): # A rule MUST have a human friendly name name = \"body-max-line-count\" # A rule MUST have a *unique* id, we recommend starting with UC (for # User-defined Commit-rule). id = \"UC1\" # A rule MAY have an option_spec if its behavior should be configurable. options_spec = [IntOption('max-line-count', 3, \"Maximum body line count\")] def validate(self, commit): line_count = len(commit.message.body) max_line_count = self.options['max-line-count'].value if line_count > max_line_count: message = f\"Body contains too many lines ({line_count} > {max_line_count})\" return [RuleViolation(self.id, message, line_nr=1)] By using options_spec , you make your option available to be configured through a .gitlint file or one of the other ways to configure gitlint . Gitlint automatically takes care of the parsing and input validation. For example, to change the value of the max-line-count option, add the following to your .gitlint file: [body-max-line-count] body-max-line-count=1 As options_spec is a list, you can obviously have multiple options per rule. The general signature of an option is: Option(name, default_value, description) . Gitlint supports a variety of different option types, all can be imported from gitlint.options : Option Class Use for StrOption Strings IntOption Integers. IntOption takes an optional allow_negative parameter if you want to allow negative integers. BoolOption Booleans. Valid values: true , false . Case-insensitive. ListOption List of strings. Comma separated. PathOption Directory or file path. Takes an optional type parameter for specifying path type ( file , dir (=default) or both ). RegexOption String representing a Python-style regex - compiled and validated before rules are applied. Note Gitlint currently does not support options for all possible types (e.g. float, list of int, etc). We could use a hand getting those implemented ! Configuration Rules Introduced in gitlint v0.14.0 Configuration rules are special rules that are applied once per commit and BEFORE any other rules are run. Configuration rules are meant to dynamically change gitlint's configuration and/or the commit that is about to be linted. A typically use-case for this is when you want to modifying gitlint's behavior for all rules against a commit matching specific circumstances. Warning Configuration rules can drastically change the way gitlint behaves and are typically only needed for more advanced use-cases. We recommend you double check: Whether gitlint already supports your use-case out-of-the-box (special call-out for ignore rules which allow you to ignore (parts) of your commit message). Whether there's a Contrib Rule that implements your use-case. Whether you can implement your use-case using a regular Commit or Line user-defined rule (see above). As with other user-defined rules, the easiest way to get started is by copying my_configuration.py from the examples directory and modifying it to fit your need. # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from gitlint.rules import ConfigurationRule from gitlint.options import IntOption class ReleaseConfigurationRule(ConfigurationRule): \"\"\" This rule will modify gitlint's behavior for Release Commits. This example might not be the most realistic for a real-world scenario, but is meant to give an overview of what's possible. \"\"\" # A rule MUST have a human friendly name name = \"release-configuration-rule\" # A rule MUST have a *unique* id, we recommend starting with UCR # (for User-defined Configuration-Rule), but this can really be anything. id = \"UCR1\" # A rule MAY have an option_spec if its behavior should be configurable. options_spec = [IntOption('custom-verbosity', 2, \"Gitlint verbosity for release commits\")] def apply(self, config, commit): self.log.debug(\"ReleaseConfigurationRule: This will be visible when running `gitlint --debug`\") # If the commit title starts with 'Release', we want to modify # how all subsequent rules interpret that commit if commit.message.title.startswith(\"Release\"): # If your Release commit messages are auto-generated, the # body might contain trailing whitespace. Let's ignore that config.ignore.append(\"body-trailing-whitespace\") # Similarly, the body lines might exceed 80 chars, # let's set gitlint's limit to 200 # To set rule options use: # config.set_rule_option(<rule-name>, <rule-option>, <value>) config.set_rule_option(\"body-max-line-length\", \"line-length\", 200) # For kicks, let's set gitlint's verbosity to 2 # To set general options use # config.set_general_option(<general-option>, <value>) config.set_general_option(\"verbosity\", 2) # We can also use custom options to make this configurable config.set_general_option(\"verbosity\", self.options['custom-verbosity'].value) # Strip any lines starting with $ from the commit message # (this only affects how gitlint sees your commit message, it does # NOT modify your actual commit in git) commit.message.body = [line for line in commit.message.body if not line.startswith(\"$\")] # You can add any extra properties you want to the commit object, # these will be available later on in all rules. commit.my_property = \"This is my property\" For all available properties and methods on the config object, have a look at the LintConfig class . Please do not use any properties or methods starting with an underscore, as those are subject to change. Rule requirements As long as you stick with simple rules that are similar to the sample user-defined rules (see the examples directory), gitlint should be able to discover and execute them. While clearly you can run any python code you want in your rules, you might run into some issues if you don't follow the conventions that gitlint requires. While the rule finding source-code is the ultimate source of truth, here are some of the requirements that gitlint enforces. Rule class requirements Rules must extend from LineRule , CommitRule or ConfigurationRule Rule classes must have id and name string attributes. The options_spec is optional, but if set, it must be a list of gitlint Options. CommitRule and LineRule classes must have a validate method. In case of a CommitRule , validate must take a single commit parameter. In case of LineRule , validate must take line and commit as first and second parameters. ConfigurationRule classes must have an apply method that take config and commit as first and second parameters. LineRule classes must have a target class attributes that is set to either CommitMessageTitle or CommitMessageBody . User Rule id's cannot start with R , T , B , M or I as these rule ids are reserved for gitlint itself. Rules should have a case-insensitive unique id as only one rule can exist with a given id. While gitlint does not enforce this, having multiple rules with the same id might lead to unexpected or undeterministic behavior. extra-path requirements If extra-path is a directory, it does not need to be a proper python package, i.e. it doesn't require an __init__.py file. Python files containing user-defined rules must have a .py extension. Files with a different extension will be ignored. The extra-path will be searched non-recursively, i.e. all rule classes must be present at the top level extra-path directory. User rule classes must be defined in the modules that are part of extra-path , rules that are imported from outside the extra-path will be ignored.","title":"User Defined Rules"},{"location":"user_defined_rules/#user-defined-rules","text":"Introduced in gitlint v0.8.0 Gitlint supports the concept of user-defined rules: the ability for users to write their own custom rules in python.

Commit rules are gitlint rules that act on the entire commit at once. Once the rules are discovered, gitlint will automatically take care of applying them to the entire commit. This happens exactly once per commit. A CommitRule contrasts with a LineRule (see e.g.: examples/my_line_rules.py ) in that a CommitRule is only applied once on an entire commit while a LineRule is applied for every line in the commit (you can also apply it once to the title using a target - see the examples section below). The benefit of a commit rule is that it allows commit rules to implement more complex checks that span multiple lines and/or checks that should only be done once per commit. While every LineRule can be implemented as a CommitRule , it's usually easier and more concise to go with a LineRule if that fits your needs.","title":"Line and Commit Rules"},{"location":"user_defined_rules/#examples","text":"In terms of code, writing your own CommitRule or LineRule is very similar. The only 2 differences between a CommitRule and a LineRule are the parameters of the validate(...) method and the extra target attribute that LineRule requires.

The alternative value for target is CommitMessageBody , in which case gitlint will apply your rule to every line in the commit message body. validate(...) takes 2 parameters : Line rules get the line against which they are applied as the first parameter and the commit object of which the line is part of as second. In addition, you probably also noticed the extra options_spec class attribute which allows you to make your rules configurable.

Important The validate(...) method doesn't always need to return a list, you can just skip the return statement in case there are no violations. However, in case of a single violation, validate should return a list with a single item. The RuleViolation class has the following generic signature: RuleViolation(rule_id, message, content=None, line_nr=None): With the parameters meaning the following: Parameter Type Description rule_id string Rule's unique string id message string Short description of the violation content string (optional) the violating part of commit or line line_nr int (optional) line number in the commit message where the violation occurs. Automatically set to the correct line number for LineRule s if not set explicitly. A typical validate(...) implementation for a CommitRule would then be as follows: def validate(self, commit) for line_nr, line in commit.message.body: if \"Jon Snow\" in line: # we add 1 to the line_nr because we offset the title which is on the first line return [RuleViolation(self.id, \"Commit message has the words 'Jon Snow' in it\", line, line_nr + 1)] return [] The parameters of this RuleViolation can be directly mapped onto gitlint's output as follows:","title":"Violations"},{"location":"user_defined_rules/#options","text":"In order to make your own rules configurable, you can add an optional options_spec attribute to your rule class (supported for both LineRule and CommitRule ). # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from gitlint.rules import CommitRule, RuleViolation from gitlint.options import IntOption class BodyMaxLineCount(CommitRule): # A rule MUST have a human friendly name name = \"body-max-line-count\" # A rule MUST have a *unique* id, we recommend starting with UC (for # User-defined Commit-rule). id = \"UC1\" # A rule MAY have an option_spec if its behavior should be configurable. options_spec = [IntOption('max-line-count', 3, \"Maximum body line count\")] def validate(self, commit): line_count = len(commit.message.body) max_line_count = self.options['max-line-count'].value if line_count > max_line_count: message = f\"Body contains too many lines ({line_count} > {max_line_count})\" return [RuleViolation(self.id, message, line_nr=1)] By using options_spec , you make your option available to be configured through a .gitlint file or one of the other ways to configure gitlint . Gitlint automatically takes care of the parsing and input validation. For example, to change the value of the max-line-count option, add the following to your .gitlint file: [body-max-line-count] body-max-line-count=1 As options_spec is a list, you can obviously have multiple options per rule. The general signature of an option is: Option(name, default_value, description) . Gitlint supports a variety of different option types, all can be imported from gitlint.options : Option Class Use for StrOption Strings IntOption Integers. IntOption takes an optional allow_negative parameter if you want to allow negative integers. BoolOption Booleans. Valid values: true , false . Case-insensitive. ListOption List of strings. Comma separated. PathOption Directory or file path. Takes an optional type parameter for specifying path type ( file , dir (=default) or both ). RegexOption String representing a Python-style regex - compiled and validated before rules are applied.

A typically use-case for this is when you want to modifying gitlint's behavior for all rules against a commit matching specific circumstances. Warning Configuration rules can drastically change the way gitlint behaves and are typically only needed for more advanced use-cases. We recommend you double check: Whether gitlint already supports your use-case out-of-the-box (special call-out for ignore rules which allow you to ignore (parts) of your commit message).
