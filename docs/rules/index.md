Gitlint has different types of rules:

- **[Built-in rules](builtin_rules.md)**: the rules that come with gitlint and are enabled by default.
- **[Community **contrib**uted rules](contrib_rules.md)**: disabled by default, but can be enabled through configuration.
- **[User-defined rule](user_defined_rules/index.md)**: your own rules written in a few lines of python.
- **[Named rules](named_rules.md)**: multiple instances of rules, identified by unique names of your choosing
