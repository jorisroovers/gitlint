Gitlint has different types of rules:

- **[Built-in rules](builtin_rules.md)**: the rules that come with gitlint and are enabled by default.
- **[Community **contrib**uted rules](contrib_rules.md)**: disabled by default, but can be enabled through configuration.
- **[User-defined rule](user_defined_rules.md)**: your own rules writting in a few lines of python.
- **[Named rules](named_rules.md)**: additional instances of rules, identified by unique names of your choosing

<!-- 

Gitlint also has [community **contrib**uted rules](contrib_rules.md) which are not listed here as they're disabled by default.

In addition, you can also [write your own user-defined rule](user_defined_rules.md) in case you don't find
what you're looking for.
