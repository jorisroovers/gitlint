      # Hatch versioning is based on git (using hatch-vcs). If there is no explicit tag for the commit we're trying to
      # publish, hatch versioning strings will have this format: 0.19.0.dev52+g9f7dc7d
      # With the string after '+' being the 'g<short-sha>' of the commit.
      #
      # However, PyPI doesn't allow '+' in version numbers (no PEP440 local versions allowed on PyPI).
      # To work around this, we override the version string by setting the SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION env var
      # to the version string without the '+' and everything after it.
      # We do this by setting the `gitlint_version` step output here and re-using it later to
      # set SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION.
      #
      # We only actually publish such releases on the main branch to guarantee the dev numbering scheme remains
      # unique.
      # Note that when a tag *is* present (i.e. v0.19.0), hatch versioning will return the tag name (i.e. 0.19.0)
      # and this step has no effect, ie. SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION will be the same as `hatch version`.
