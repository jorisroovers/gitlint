<!--- THIS IS A COMMENT BLOCK, REMOVE IT BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR

Thank you for your interest in gitlint and putting in the effort to create a PR!

A few quick notes:

- It's really just me (https://github.com/jorisroovers) maintaining gitlint, and I do so in a hobby capacity. More recently it has become harder for me to find time to maintain gitlint on a regular basis, which in practice means that it might take me a while (sometimes months) to get back to you. Rest assured though, I absolutely look at all PRs as soon as they come in - I just tend to only "work" on gitlint a few times a year.
- Similarly, after your code is merged, it typically still takes months before I do another release that contains your code. Please don't let that deter you from contributing - I appreciate your patience and understanding!
