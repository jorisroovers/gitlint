Thank you for your interest in gitlint and taking the time to open a bug report!

A few quick notes:

- If you can, please include the output of `gitlint --debug` as this includes useful debugging info.
- It's really just me (https://github.com/jorisroovers) maintaining gitlint, and I do so in a hobby capacity. More recently it has become harder for me to find time to maintain gitlint on a regular basis, which in practice means that it might take me a while (sometimes months) to get back to you. Rest assured though, I absolutely read all bug reports as soon as they come in - I just tend to only "work" on gitlint a few times a year.
