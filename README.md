## Contributing ##
All contributions are welcome and very much appreciated!

**I'm [looking for contributors](https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint/issues/134) that are interested in taking a more active co-maintainer role as it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to find time to maintain gitlint. Please open a PR if you're interested - Thanks!**

See [jorisroovers.github.io/gitlint/contributing](http://jorisroovers.github.io/gitlint/contributing) for details on
how to get started - it's easy!

We maintain a [loose roadmap on our wiki](https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint/wiki/Roadmap).
