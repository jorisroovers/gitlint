## Contributing ##
All contributions are welcome and very much appreciated!

**I'm [looking for contributors](https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint/issues/134) that are interested in taking a more active co-maintainer role as it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to find time to maintain gitlint. Please leave a comment in [#134](https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint/issues/134) if you're interested!**

See [jorisroovers.github.io/gitlint/contributing](http://jorisroovers.github.io/gitlint/contributing) for details on
how to get started - it's easy!

We maintain a [loose project plan on Github Projects](https://github.com/users/jorisroovers/projects/1/views/1).
