# [title-max-length]

# [title-must-not-contain-word]
# Comma-separated list of words that should not occur in the title. Matching is case
# insensitive. It's fine if the keyword occurs as part of a larger word (so "WIPING"
# will not cause a violation, but "WIP: my title" will.

# [title-match-regex]
# python like regex (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) that the
# commit-msg title must be matched to.
# Note that the regex can contradict with other rules if not used correctly
# (e.g. title-must-not-contain-word).

# [body-changed-file-mention]
# List of files that need to be explicitly mentioned in the body when they are changed

# Use 'all' to ignore all rules

# Ignore certain rules for commits of which the body has a line that matches a regex
# E.g. Match bodies that have a line that that contain "release"
