# python like regex (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) that the

# [body-changed-file-mention]
# List of files that need to be explicitly mentioned in the body when they are changed

# [author-valid-email]
# python like regex (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) that the

# For example, use the following regex if you only want to allow email addresses from foo.com
# regex = "[^@]+@foo.com"
