"""
Full details on user-defined rules: https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/user_defined_rules

The ReleaseConfigurationRule class below is an example of a user-defined ConfigurationRule. Configuration rules are
gitlint rules that are applied once per commit and BEFORE any other rules are run. Configuration Rules are meant to
dynamically change gitlint's configuration and/or the commit that is about to be linted. A typically use-case for this
is modifying the behavior of gitlint's rules based on a commit contents.

Notes:
- Modifying the commit object DOES NOT modify the actual git commit message in the target repo, only gitlint's copy of
  it.
- Modifying the config object only has effect on the commit that is being linted, subsequent commits will not
  automatically inherit this configuration.
