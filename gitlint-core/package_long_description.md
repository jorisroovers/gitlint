Great for use as a commit-msg git hook or as part of your gating script in a CI pipeline (e.g. jenkins, github actions).
Many of the gitlint validations are based on [well-known](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
[community](https://addamhardy.com/2013-06-05-good-commit-messages-and-enforcing-them-with-git-hooks)
[standards](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), others are based on checks that
we've found useful throughout the years. Gitlint has sane defaults, but you can also easily customize it to your
own liking.
